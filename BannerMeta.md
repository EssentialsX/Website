# BannerMeta
BannerMeta lets you create custom flag designs for banners and shields. Each banner can have unlimited patterns and patterns listed first will go below patterns listed later.

## Base Color
Base color should be the first thing listed for a banner. It will be displayed as RGB. Base color will show under all patterns.


## Patterns
Patterns will be listed after the base color and will include the type with the color listed after a comma.
