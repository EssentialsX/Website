# Modules

## Core

The core EssentialsX jar contains many of the core features for most servers. This includes most commands as well as signs, kits and the economy. **You need this jar for all the other modules to work.**

## EssentialsX AntiBuild

**EssentialsX AntiBuild** adds permissions to your server that gives you fine control over which players can build, interact with blocks or craft on your server. You can control individual items and blocks for specific groups or users, or simply allow or deny entire groups from building at all using build flags. It also includes an alert system for when players use certain items. For more information, see the [AntiBuild wiki page](http://wiki.mc-ess.net/wiki/AntiBuild) (item IDs have been removed in 1.13+).

Note that AntiBuild doesn't include any kind of region protection; to restrict building in specific regions we recommend installing [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).

*We recommend you use [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) with AntiBuild to make the most of its features.*

## EssentialsX Chat

**EssentialsX Chat** includes many of EssentialsX's chat features. It allows you to customise chat formatting on your server by adding prefixes, suffixes and colours in chat, as well as setting different formats for different groups.

*You need [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/34315/) and [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/download) to give players prefixes and suffixes and to detect groups.*

## EssentialsX GeoIP

**EssentialsX GeoIP** displays an approximate lookup of where your players come from based on looking up their IP in a geographical database. This lookup can be seen by admins either when players log in or in `/whois`.

## EssentialsX Protect

**EssentialsX Protect** allows you to control some simple settings for your worlds, like preventing creepers from damaging buildings, disabling fire spread and blocking certain types of mob spawns.

Note that Protect doesn't include any kind of region protection; to protect specific regions we recommend installing [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard).

## EssentialsX Spawn

**EssentialsX Spawn** lets you control where players spawn both when they first join the server and when they die. You can use the in-game `/setspawn` command to set a spawn location for everyone on your server as well as for specific groups.

## EssentialsX XMPP

**EssentialsX XMPP** acts as a bridge between Jabber/XMPP chat networks and your server. This allows players to chat between XMPP networks and your server, and can also allow server admins to monitor the console and server errors remotely. For more information, see the [Essentials XMPP guide](https://wiki.mc-ess.net/wiki/XMPP).

*If you don't know what XMPP is, you don't need this!*

<!--
**EssentialsX Link** (coming soon) acts as a bridge between chat services such as Discord and your Minecraft server. This allows players to chat between Discord and your server, as well as letting players link their Discord and Minecraft accounts for special ranks.

**EssentialsX Potato** integrates your Minecraft server with the well-known culinary open source project [Potato](https://github.com/drtshock/Potato). This ensures you always have the finest high-quality potatos ready to go!
