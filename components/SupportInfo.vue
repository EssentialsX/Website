                    EssentialsX officially supports the <b>CraftBukkit</b>, <b>Spigot</b> and <a href="https://papermc.io/"><b>Paper (recommended)</b></a> server software running the following Minecraft versions:
                </p>            
                <ul>
                    <li>‚úÖ <b>1.16.5</b> - EssentialsX actively develops against and supports these versions.</li>
                    <li>‚ö†Ô∏è <b>1.8.8</b>, <b>1.9.4</b>, <b>1.10.2</b>, <b>1.11.2</b>, <b>1.12.2</b>, <b>1.13.2</b>, <b>1.14.4</b> and <b>1.15.2</b> - these versions are still supported, but are not a priority for us, and may be dropped in a future release.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>We strongly recommend using the latest version of Paper.</b> Paper includes countless bug fixes and performance improvements over Spigot and CraftBukkit, including fixing some non-vanilla behaviours, and EssentialsX takes advantage of more efficient <b>async teleports</b> and support for modern gameplay features which are only possible on Paper, not Spigot.
