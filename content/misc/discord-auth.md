Once you've created your bot at the Discord Developers site, enter your client ID into the box below (you should have
copied this from step two of the [setup guide](/docs/2.x/Discord-Tutorial)).

Once you enter your client ID into the box below, clicking **Authorize** will redirect you to Discord's website. From
here, you'll be able to select from any server you have the **Manage Server** permission in to add it in. Once you've
added the bot to a server, you can continue the next step in the setup guide.
