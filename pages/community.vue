                            <p>
                                For all the old-fashioned folk out there, you can join <strong>#essentialsx</strong> over on <strong>irc.esper.net</strong>.
                                Note that the IRC channel is less active, so if you're looking for quick support, we strongly recommend joining MOSS on Discord instead.
