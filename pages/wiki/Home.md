**Note:** When updating EssentialsX, you need to update *all* the modules to the same version to prevent version mismatch errors. In addition, you may want to update your config file - the latest config file can always be found [here](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/blob/2.x/Essentials/src/main/resources/config.yml).

## Updating from Essentials 2

EssentialsX is a fork of the original [Essentials project](https://github.com/essentials/Essentials), which was discontinued in 2014. EssentialsX adds several new features over the original Essentials - [the Improvements page](/wiki/Improvements.html) and [EssentialsX changelogs](https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials/releases) for more information.

To upgrade from Essentials 2.14.x or earlier, stop your server, delete the old Essentials jars and replace them with the equivalent EssentialsX jars. We recommend renaming your `config.yml` file to take advantage of new settings added by EssentialsX, and taking a full backup of your `plugins/Essentials/` folder. Once you restart your server, EssentialsX will create a new `config.yml` and update old user data to the new format.
